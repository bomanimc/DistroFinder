# DistroFinder
DistroFinder is a Node, Express, and Angular application that we had the chance to build at WildHacks Hackathon in 2014. DistroFinder helps students in Weinberg College of Arts & Sciences at Northwestern find out about available courses that will fill Distribution requirements for their degree. DistroFinder utilizes the Northwestern Course Data API (http://developer.asg.northwestern.edu/) for information about courses.

We used this to learn about web development. It was our first web application using this stack!
